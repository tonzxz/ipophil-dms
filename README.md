# System Design Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system design, encompassing the technology stack, component usage, troubleshooting procedures, database schema, API usage, and server configuration. The goal is to offer a clear understanding of the architecture and operational details to facilitate development, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

## 1. Technology Stack

### 1.1 Frontend

- **Next.js**: Utilized for enhanced performance features, including updates to app directory routing, optimizations in the server-side rendering (SSR) pipeline, and support for React Server Components. These updates significantly improve developer experience and page load performance compared to v14. Using v15 ensures the system remains futureproof and benefits from the latest community and framework support.
  - [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)

- **React**: React v19 introduces modern rendering capabilities, including improvements to React Server Components, concurrent rendering, and built-in support for strict mode debugging tools. These features enhance interactivity and maintain performance in large-scale, dynamic applications. Using the latest stable React version ensures compatibility with Next.js v15 and takes full advantage of recent advancements in the React ecosystem.

- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with a focus on responsiveness and customization.

### 1.2 State Management

- **Zustand**: A lightweight state management library that provides efficient and straightforward state management, ideal for small to medium-sized applications.

### 1.3 Backend Integration

- **Next.js API routes**: Used for server-side logic, allowing for seamless integration between frontend and backend within the same framework.
- **Express.js**: Used for additional backend logic and API routing, providing flexibility and control over server-side operations.
- **PostgreSQL (PGSQL)**: A powerful, open-source relational database system offering strong data integrity, reliability, and scalability. Unlike Supabase, using PostgreSQL directly provides greater control over database configurations, optimization, and custom SQL functionalities, aligning with the project's backend requirements.

### 1.4 Authentication

- **NextAuth.js**: Simplifies the implementation of secure authentication with support for multiple providers, making it easier to manage user authentication.

### 1.5 Utilities

- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and improves code quality by catching errors at compile time.
- **Zod**: Used for data validation, ensuring that data conforms to expected types and formats.

### 1.6 Testing

- **Cypress**: A powerful end-to-end testing framework that provides reliable testing for the entire application, ensuring quality assurance.

### 1.7 Package Management

- **pnpm**: Speeds up dependency installation and optimizes workspace management, making it more efficient than traditional package managers like npm or yarn.

## 2. Component Usage

### 2.1 Frontend Components

- **Next.js**: Used for server-side rendering and routing.
- **React**: Used for building the user interface components.
- **TailwindCSS**: Used for styling the UI components.

### 2.2 State Management

- **Zustand**: Used for managing application state efficiently.

### 2.3 Backend Integration

- **Next.js API routes**: Used for server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Express.js**: Used for API routing and custom backend logic.

### 2.4 Database

- **PostgreSQL (PGSQL)**: Used for all database operations, replacing Supabase to give full control over database configurations and features.

### 2.5 Authentication

- **NextAuth.js**: Used for managing user authentication.

### 2.6 Utilities

- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety.
- **Zod**: Used for data validation.

### 2.7 Testing

- **Cypress**: Used for end-to-end testing.

### 2.8 Package Management

- **Recommendation**: Use pnpm for its superior performance and efficiency, particularly in large-scale or multi-project environments. Its strict dependency resolution helps avoid unexpected dependency mismatches.

## 3. Troubleshooting and Maintenance

### 3.1 Basic Troubleshooting

- **Front End Issues**: Check browser console for errors, ensure all dependencies are up-to-date, and verify component rendering.
- **Backend Issues**: Check server logs, ensure API routes are correctly configured, and verify database connections.
- **State Management Issues**: Use Zustand's debugging tools to inspect state changes and ensure state is being managed correctly.

### 3.2 Maintenance Procedures

- **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated to the latest stable versions.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Testing**: Run Cypress tests regularly to catch any regressions.
- **Backup**: Regularly backup the database to prevent data loss.

## 4. Database Schema

Refer to the [Database Documentation](./database-documentation.md) for a detailed explanation of the database schema used in the system.

## 5. API Usage

Refer to the [Backend API Design](./backend-api-design.md) for a rundown of the API endpoints, their usage, and how to interact with them.

## 6. Server Configuration and Setup

### 6.1 Server Configuration

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure all necessary environment variables are set up correctly.
- **Server Logs**: Configure server logging to monitor and troubleshoot issues.
- **Security**: Implement security best practices, including HTTPS, rate limiting, and input validation.

### 6.2 Setup

- **Installation**: Follow the [Installation Guide](./installation-guide.md) to set up the development environment.
- **Deployment**: Use the [Deployment Guide](./deployment-guide.md) to deploy the application to the desired environment (e.g., production, staging).
